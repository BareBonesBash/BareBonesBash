## Introduction

This website contains very gentle step-by-step introductory walk-throughs 
to basic concepts and commands of the unix command line. It is aimed to be
light-hearted and targeted towards people with little to no computational 
experience; to allow them to get comfortable to explore at their own pace.

The objectives of the content is

- To provide a practical introduction on how to work on a Mac/Linux operating system using the command line for complete beginners (no knowledge required).
- Learn functionality on most common command line tools and how they help make your work more efficient.
- Become familiar with basic programming concepts (variables, for loops, if statements) used in all programming languages.

We have written the content in two formats - a single long-form document for
people to read through at their own pace in their own time, and a presentation 
format of the same content to help other trainers.

## Sessions

We currently have one session, and will soon be expanded to two for slightly
more advanced topics. See the sidebar for each session.
