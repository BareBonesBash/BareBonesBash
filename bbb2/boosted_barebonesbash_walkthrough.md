## Table of contents

<!-- TO INSERT WITH VSCODE -->

## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to advance your knowledge gained from [Basic BareBonesBash](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/bbb1/README). Basic BBB introduced fundamental concepts on how to do basic navigation _[Thiseas still insists on that fancy word...]_, moving and reading files, and generating basic information statistics on these files. In this session, we will focus on more realistic/'useful' scenarios when it comes to the command line. We will be covering ways of speeding up and automating tasks using more 'abstract' but very common computing concepts. However, don't worry! We will be taking it slowly and gently, and of course, full of GIFs!

## tl;dr

If you want to know what you will learn in this tutorial, or are already too scared to read the rest of this tutorial, you can look at this table as a quick reference. To understand actually what each command does, carry on reading below!

## Preparation

Before we start, we need to get a few things onto your computer that we will be playing with today. All commands in this section have been introduced in _Basic_ BareBonesBash, so check there if anything is unfamiliar.

Firstly, lets make a new directory 

```bash
$ mkdir boosted_barebonesbash
```

> here we assuming you're in to your home directory, but feel free to put it somewhere else. Just make sure you check all subsequent paths in the rest of the walkthrough!

Now we download the first file, and rename it to something more informative

```bash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-meta
$ mv Boosted-BBB-meta boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

> **Tip**:If using a mac use 'curl -LO' instead!

We will now change into that directory and download a second file. This file is actually zipped, so we will also decompress this.

```bash
$ cd boosted_barebonesbash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-images
$ unzip Boosted-BBB-images

## and remove the original zip archive
$ rm Boosted-BBB-images
```

## Where is my stuff??

One of first things you want to do when working on the command line is to find out where the directories/files that you want to work with are. In these modern times, this can be hundreds or even thousands of files.

<p align="center">
  <img title="https://giphy.com/gifs/download-find-funsubstancea-XSJIE5xMWA9HO
" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XSJIE5xMWA9HO/giphy.gif">
</p>

So, how can you search for files and directories hidden in layers and layers of (your of course very organised ;)) directories?

For this task, you can use the command `find`

Let's see how this command works with an example:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*JPG'
```

The **first** part of the `find` command indicates **the place from which to start looking**, in the example above, this is the directory `Boosted-BBB`. You can also specify:

- `.` to look in here (the current directory)
- `~/` to look in your home directory
- Absolute path (i.e.`/home/james`). Note: This will print the absolute path and the found file/directory, it is useful when you want to use the output of `find` for other things

> Keep in mind that it will look in the directory specified and all of it's subdirectories unless indicated otherwise!

The **second** part of the `find` command indicates **what type of things you are looking for**

- Use `-type` to define the file type

    - **f**ile
    - **d**irectory

In the example above we are looking for files (`-type f`)

The **third** part of the `find` command is **what to look in**

- Use `-name` to say 'look in the *names* of things'

**Finally**, we provide the actual string to look for.

In the example above, we look for files that contain `JPG` in some part of their name (`'*JPG*'`).
- You can use wildcards (\*) for maximum laziness! 

Check what the output of the find command is by, running it:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*JPG'
```

You can also store the string we are looking for in a variable instead! By doing this, you can change the string for another easily in the future (this will be useful when creating scripts, which we will cover later in the session), without having to modify the command itself. 

To do so, let's store our string `JPG` in a variable:

```bash
$ suffix="JPG"
```

Let's try now to call the variable in our find command as:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB -type f -name '*$suffix'
```

**BUT WAIT**! There was no output? It did not find any of the files!!?

But we know the files do exist (_trust us_)! Let's try the following command istead:

```
find Boosted-BBB -type f -name "*$suffix"
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://tenor.com/view/nagato-naruto-shippuden-nagato-kid-nani-apa-gif-12417317.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/nagato-naruto-shippuden-nagato-kid-nani-apa-gif-12417317.gif" width="70%">
</p>

üéâ It found your files! What is the difference between these commands?

That's right! The _quotes_!

## Concept: Quotes matter!

Which quotes you use plays an important role in how bash understands the message contained within them:

* Single quotes: the content is passed on as it is written
* Double quotes: the content is _interpreted_

In some cases, the way you write the statments does not matter, as in the following example:

```bash
$ echo "I like Greek Food"
$ echo 'I like Greek Food'
```
This two statements will result in the same (universally true) printed message:

```
I like Greek Food
I like Greek Food
```

Now let's consider the following example:

```bash
$ Arr=Banana
$ echo 'Pirates say $Arr'
$ echo "Minions say $Arr"
```

Here, the results are different:

```
Pirates say $Arr
Minions say Banana
```

<p align="center">
    <div class="row">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/NSqQkXJjnsVpZQezfg/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/NSqQkXJjnsVpZQezfg/" width="90%">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/bh4jzePjmd9iE/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/bh4jzePjmd9iE/" width="90%">
    </div>
</p>

As you can see in the case of single quotes, bash does not interpret the variable `$Arr` as Banana, since it is not being translated by the computer to the correct meaning. In the case of the double quotes, the program understands `$Arr` as a variable, and interprets it to mean the string contained within it which is`"Banana"`. 

Now, let's continue with your files!

## Cleaning up the filenames

So... you found your files, but it seems that whoever ave you files has (üëÄ) completely mangled the file names (_[What is with this weird file extention `.JPG.MP3.TXT`???]_]

You know that already that these files are supposed to be images with the extension `.JPG` (_[clearly]_). So let's clean up the file names, and then we can sort them into categories. 

There are different ways to tackle this problem. First, we will show you an example that uses `cut` and `rev`.

Can you guess what these commands do?

* `rev`: reverses a character string
* `cut`: cuts a string into multiple pieces

<div class="row">
<p align="center">
  <img style="transform: scaleX(-1)" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mUGRVgAkamLZe/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/pony-mUGRVgAkamLZe" width="90%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img style="transform: scaleX(-1)" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2GdACZsbRnTmo/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-photoset-2GdACZsbRnTmo" width="83%">
</p>
</div>

Let's try them out!

```bash
$ echo "aBcDeF 654321" | rev
```

This results in:

```text
123456 FeDcBa
```

Now let's see how `cut` work. This command needs some options to know how to deal with the string. Those are:

* `-d` specifies the field **d**elimiter we are using. Here it is space (" ").
* `-f` specifies which **f**ield we wish to cut out. We want to recover the numbers, so this will be the second field.
* 
> For more options, check the `man` page!

Let's write the command to obtain the number then:

```bash
$echo "aBcDeF 654321" | cut -d " " -f 2
```

And the result is:

```
654321
```

So let's combine these two tools to clean up our file names. 

You will use a `for` loop to change all the file names you have found with the `find` command to the desired ending (filename containing only the `.JPG` extension)

The `for` loop will look like this:

```bash
$ suffix=JPG
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>    new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>    echo $file $new_name
> done
```

> **Tip**: Remember that the `>` at the beginning of a code block 
> indicates a multi-line command. You can replace these with `;` 
> to write the whole loop on a single line
 
You should use `echo` to make a 'dry-run', meaning that you can try your code without making any changes to files themselves. 

When you are happy with the output from the echo command, you can replace `echo` with the `mv` command, and re-run the `for` loop to change the name of the file for the `$new_name`.

```bash
$ suffix=JPG
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>    new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>    mv $file $new_name
> done
```

But hold up...

**This code is cumbersome to write, read and understand.**

<p align="center"><img src="https://tenor.com/view/what-confused-ugh-blackadder-rowan-atkinson-gif-11050590.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/what-confused-ugh-blackadder-rowan-atkinson-gif-11050590.gif" width="40%">
</p>

### Wait, what just happened? 

Let's break the code in parts to understand what is going on:

* `for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do`: this starts the for loop. The `$()` tells bash to use the _output_ of the `find` command as the list to loop through. 
    * `new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)`: `$()` tells bash to run the commands within parenthesis and interpret the output as a string. The string is then assigned to the `new_name` variable
        * `echo $file`: print the filepath
    
        `~/boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB/Friday/night/and/the/lights/are/low/fanta.JPG.MP3.TXT`
    
        * `rev`: **rev**erses the file name:
        `TXT.3PM.GPJ.atnaf/wol/era/sthgil/eht/dna/thgin/yadirF/BBB-detsooB/hsabsenoberab_detsoob/~`
        * `cut -d "." -f 2-999`: **cut**s the string at each "." (the `-d`elimiter) and keeps everything after the first delimiter (`-f`ields `2-999`):
         `3PM.GPJ.atnaf/wol/era/sthgil/eht/dna/thgin/yadirF/BBB-detsooB/hsabsenoberab_detsoob/~`
        * `rev`: **rev**erses to the original file name: 
        `~/boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB/Friday/night/and/the/lights/are/low/fanta.JPG.MP3`
    * `mv`: Finally, we rename the file to `new_name` with `mv`
* `done`: complete the loop
    
### Writing pretty code

The code we just saw was long and unnecessary. It is a good idea to avoid clunky code, because often it can be slow but more importantly unreadable to yourself and others!


To simplify this code we can instead use bash's **parameter expansion**! (It's magic!)

<p align="center"><img src="https://tenor.com/view/fantastic-beasts-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-strudel-magic-food-gif-7865320.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/fantastic-beasts-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-strudel-magic-food-gif-7865320.gif" width="50%">
</p>

## Parameter expansion: Without the parameters

Parameter expansion is a feature in bash that allows you to manipulate _variables_. Let's explore some examples!

Given the variable:

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
```

You can expand the variable by using `${}`, like this:

```bash
$ echo ${foo}
```
"Expansion" of a variable is just "unpacking" of the variable to see its contents. So the code above will result into bash printing the variable's contents:

```bash
$ /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
```

This expansion is implied whenever you omit the curly brackets (`$foo` instead of `${foo}`). However, it is still a good idea to include these curly brackets, as it helps to visually distinguish variable names in your code, and to remove any ambiguity as to which is the name of the variable you are trying to expand. 

### Parameter expansion: _with_ parameters!

By adding parameters inside the variable expansion curly brackets, it is also possible to change the way that the variable contents are expanded <ins>without changing the variable definition itself!</ins>. 

Here are some examples:

* `#string`: removes the string from the left side of the variable
    ```bash
    $ echo ${foo}
    $ echo ${foo#/home/}
    ```
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    `
    thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    
* `%string`: removes the string starting from the right side of the variable
    ```bash
    $ echo ${foo}
    $ echo ${foo%.txt}
    ```
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
    `
    
You can use wildcards within this parameterised expansions as below:

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"

$ echo ${foo}    # No parameters in this expansion
$ echo ${foo#*/} # Removes everything before the first '/'
$ echo ${foo%.*} # Removes everything after the last '.'
```
Results in:

```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
```

Additionally, to remove __all__ matches of the specified pattern, you can repeat the parameter specifier a second time (`##` or `%%`):

```bash
$ echo ${foo##*/} # Removes everything before any '/'
$ echo ${foo%%.*} # Removes everything after any '.'
```

`
BBB.is.bae.txt
`

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB
`

### More parameters for expansion

Other than removing parts of the variable contents, parameters will allow you to substitute only parts of them as well!

* `/pattern/string`: substitutes the first occurrence of the pattern in the variable contents by the given string

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}                    # No parameters
$ echo ${foo/BBB/BareBonesBash}  # Change "BBB" to "BareBonesBash"
```

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
`

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BareBonesBash.is.bae.txt
`

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/adweek-color-apple-8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/links" width="75%">
</p>

Omitting the string will remove the given pattern (i.e. replace it with an empty string).

*  `/pattern/`: substitutes the string with an empty string

```bash
$ echo ${foo/BBB}  # Remove BBB
```
`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/.is.bae.txt
`

As before, repeating the parameter specifier (`/`) will apply the substitution to __all__ matches of the pattern!

```bash
$ echo ${foo}
$ echo ${foo//is/IS} ## Replace any occurance of 'is' to 'IS'
$ echo ${foo//is} ## Remove all occurances of 'is'
```
`/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt`
`/home/thISeas/folder/subfolder/BBB.IS.bae.txt`
`/home/theas/folder/subfolder/BBB..bae.txt`

### The last parameter, I swear!

Finally, you can check the length of the variable contents (how many characters long they are) by using a `#` BEFORE the variable name.

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${#foo}  # The length of the variable contents
```
`45`

So the filepath in `foo` is 45 characters long!

" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9DLukkavmhybAs/giphy.gif
" width="40%">
</p>

This parameter will become more handy when when dealing with bash _arrays_ (i.e. lists of things), but these will not be introduced here.

## Writing pretty code
We can now rewrite the code below:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>   new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>   echo $file $new_name
> done
```

To this:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*JPG*"); do
>   echo ${file} ${file%.*}
> done
```

Try running both codes using only the printing command `echo` before modifying the actual variable (dry-running) and check that the result is the same! 

Is there a difference in runtime?

Using a command timer on both for loops above, I got the result: `0.051s` versus `0.003s` respectively! Parameter expansion is quicker because it does not rely on piping together 4 different commands.

<p align="center">

</p>

When you are sure the filename `${file%.*}` is as intended, replace `echo` with `mv` in the 2nd codeblock to rename the files! The final code should look like this:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*JPG*"); do
>   mv ${file} ${file%.*}
> done
```

## Almost done!

We now have all the files named similarly, but some things are still a bit off. The file suffix `.JPG` is conventionally written in lowercase characters (i.e. `.jpg`).

So, let's change all filename suffixes to be in lowercase letters!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3diMwu8XYh6sa6VG/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/laffmobbslafftracks-laff-mobbs-tracks-episode-108-l3diMwu8XYh6sa6VG" width="30%">
</p>

While this operation could also be done with a parameter expansion substituting each filename one by one, we can be EVEN LAZIER and use something called **reg**ular **ex**pressions (a.k.a regex). This allows us to do this without a for loop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/kaNy16D5G7fyybuIZ4/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/cbs-ncisla-1110-ncisla1110-kaNy16D5G7fyybuIZ4" width="30%">
</p>

Regex is an important concept that you encounter in most programming languages.

The actual way you write regex may vary from language to language, but the concept is essentially the same. In the following section, we will show here's how they work in bash!

## Concept: Regular expressions

Regex are special strings and characters that define a 'search pattern'. 

They are normally used in 'Search' or 'Search/Replace' functions e.g. in Excel! And: **You have already used them!** (sort of)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KWbmr5E1UdPUI/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/way-matt01ss-KWbmr5E1UdPUI/links" width="30%">
</p>


There are three regex special character 'categories' you should keep in mind:

* `.`, `*`, `^`, `$` (etc.): 
    * special characters <br>These are translated to regex **by default**. They can be "escaped" with `\` when you wish to use the literal symbol instead.
* `\t`, `\w`, `\D` (etc.): 
    * letter-based special characters <br> These characters require `\` to be 'translated' (i.e. the opposite of special characters).
* `[]`, `()`, (etc.): 
    * range, grouping, or 'capturing' matching regex <br> These can be specified within different types of brackets

We will showcase them by applying some search function in a file. For this, you will need to download the file `regex.txt` using the code below.

```bash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-regex
$ mv Boosted-BBB-regex regex.txt
```
Let's also look at the contents of this file.

```bash
$ cat regex.txt
```

Try to remember the contents of the file for the next few steps (or if you forget, re-run the command to remind yourself!)

Now let's see which 'parameters' we can use to try to find different words using grep!

#### 1. `.` : **matches any character.** 

The code below:

```bash
$ grep '.ear' regex.txt
```

> Finds strings containing: any character + ear

Prints:

```
pear
bear
rear
```

</p>

#### 2. `[]`: **match range of characters within the square brackets.**

Try:

```bash
$ grep 'p[iea]r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with p+[one of: i, e, a]+r

And you should see:

```
pir
per
par
```

#### 3. `[^]`: **match range of characters excluding the ones in the square brackets.**

Run:

```bash
$ grep 'p[^iea]r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with p+[any except: i, e, a]+r

And you should get:

```
pur
```

#### 4. `*`: **match 0 or more of the preceding items**

```bash
$ grep 'be*r' regex.txt
```

> String that starts with b+ zero or more 'e' +r

You should get:

```
beer
br
ber
```

</p>

#### 5. `\`: **do not interpret next character**

```bash
$ grep 'be\*r' regex.txt
```

> String 'be*r'

Gives:

```
be*r
```
By escaping the asterisk, the regex looks for an *actual* asterisk character instead of matching 0 or more of the preceding items.

#### 6. `\+`: **match 1 or more of the preceding items**

```bash
$ grep 'be\+r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with b+ one or multiple 'e'+r

Matches:

```
beer
ber
```
Notice the difference in the resulting matches between `\+` and `*`! `br` is NOT matched with `\+` because we arre looking for *at least one* `e`.

</p>

#### 7. `\?`: match 0 or 1 of the preceding items

```bash
$ grep 'be\?r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with b+ zero or one 'e' +r

You should get:

```
br
ber
```
Compare the matching results to those of `\+`. `beer` is no longer matched because it has two `e` characters and `\?` matches only up to one.

<!-- Thiseas got up to here -->

#### 8. `^`: the beginning of the line

```bash
$ grep '^[rb]\+' regex.txt
```

> Lines starting with one or multiple of: r or b

You should get:

```
bear
beer
br
ber
be*r
rear
```

</p>

#### 9. `$`: the end of the line

```bash
$ grep 'r$' regex.txt
```

> Line ending with r

```
pear
pier
pir
per
par
pur
bear
beer
br
ber
be*r
rear
```

## Regex example!

Now, going back to our list of files

```
fanta.JPG
BydgoszczForest.JPG
snore.JPG
Bubobubo.JPG
giacomo.JPG
netsukeJapan.JPG
nomnom.JPG
pompeii.JPG
AlopochenaegyptiacaArnhem.JPG

```

What sort of regex would you use to find all files ending with `.JPG`?

If we want to match a specific set of characters, that always follow a `.` and and then end of string?

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*.JPG'
```

Oooh look, we've done this before üòâ.

## `rename`

So while we can find the files with regex, how do we actually rename them in the super-lazy and fast method we mentioned above?

We can use a tool called `rename`!

`rename` lets you apply a regex to the name of files to rename them!

> Note: this is not always installed be default in some Unix operating systems, but is almost always easily installable via the corresponding package manager.

To convert all suffixes in the directory to lowercase characters:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*.JPG' | rename 's/\.JPG$/.jpg/'
```

You may note that substitution is written similar to what we used in parameter expansion (except with an extra `/`)!

> Check with `find` whether the names are now as you expect!

This 'one-liner' demonstrates that you don't need a for-loop to rename lots of files! Just pipe!

</p>


To go into more detail what is exactly happening in the command above:


1. We define we want to **s**ubstitute the regex matches for another string

2. We define the regex to query. `\.JPG$`

> Remember, we want to have the actual `.` character in the search string - therefore we _escape_ so it is not 'translated' by regex.

3. Finally, we specify what we want to substitute any matches to the search string with, which in this case is `.jpg`

## Onwards!

Ok, so we can now again use find to see all the new and pretty and cleaned up filepaths:

```bash
$ suffix="jpg"
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*${suffix}"
```

</p>

Lets start sorting the pictures into categories, which we can later file under relevant folder names!

To do that, we need to keep track of all the file names. We can easily gather this information using a **redirect**!

## Concept: Datastreams!

Programs can take in and spit out data from different _streams_. By default there are 3 such data streams.

- `stdin`: the __st__ an __d__ ard __in__ put
- `stdout`: the __st__ an __d__ ard  __out__ put
- `stderr`: the __st__ an __d__ ard   __err__ or

_A program is like the human body; One way in, two ways out!_

# Pipes revisited

In the first session you learned about piping. Here's how that works!

<img src=".images/Piping.png" width="100%">

<!-- image is stored in github repo so relative link won't work on hack.md -->

With a pipe, the `stdout` of one command becomes the `stdin` of the next!

`stderr` is printed on your screen.

# Concept: Redirects

Much like streams in the real world, datastreams can be redirected.

This way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file to save for later!


- `stdin` can be redirected with `<`.
    - An arrow pointing TO your program name!

- `stdout` can be redirected with `>`.
    - An arrow pointing AWAY your program name!

- `stderr` can be redirected with `2>`.
    - Because it is the secondary output stream.

It is also possible to combine streams, but we won't get into that here.

</p>

# Let's redirect!

We can get a list of all the file names by redirecting the `stdout` of the `find` command.

```bash
$ suffix="jpg"
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*${suffix}" > File_names.txt
```

This time, nothing was printed on your screen. But don't panic, because you _redirected_ that output into the file specified after the `>`.

You can `cat` the resulting file to see that everything worked!

# Getting parts of a file path

Before moving on, there are two useful commands you should know.

`basename` will tell you the file name, while _stripping the path_ to the file.
```bash
$ basename data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life/bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```
```
bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```


`dirname`, on the otherhand, does the opposite. It will tell you the path to the directory that a file is in, while _omitting the name_ of the file.
```bash
$ dirname data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life/bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```
```
data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life
```

# Reading from a file

Ok, so you now have a file with all the paths to the images we need. But the folder structure that files are in is still a mess. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7vARoDgcIknS5wBQq6/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/abba-waterloo-7vARoDgcIknS5wBQq6" width="35%">
</p>

It's time to read the contents of the file with a `while` loop!

A `while` loop is a special type of repeating code that keeps going until it is interrupted.

We will also use `read`. This command takes the contents of the file and loads them into a specified variable.
