## Table of contents

<!-- TO INSERT WITH VSCODE -->

## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to advance your knowledge gained from [Basic BareBonesBash](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/bbb1/README). Basic BBB introduced fundamental concepts on how to do basic navigation _[Thiseas still insists on that fancy word...]_, moving and reading files, and generating basic information statistics on these files. In this session, we will focus on more realistic/'useful' scenarios when it comes to the command line. We will be covering ways of speeding up and automating tasks using more 'abstract' but very common computing concepts. However, don't worry! We will be taking it slowly and gently, and of course, full of GIFs!

## tl;dr

If you want to know what you will learn in this tutorial, or are already too scared to read the rest of this tutorial, you can look at this table as a quick reference. To understand actually what each command does, carry on reading below!

## Preparation

Before we start, we need to get a few things onto your computer that we will be playing with today. All commands in this section have been introduced in _Basic_ BareBonesBash, so check there if anything is unfamiliar.

Firstly, lets make a new directory 

```bash
$ mkdir boosted_barebonesbash
```

> here we assuming you're in to your home directory, but feel free to put it somewhere else. Just make sure you check all subsequent paths in the rest of the walkthrough!

Now we download the first file, and rename it to something more informative

```bash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-meta
$ mv Boosted-BBB-meta boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

> **Tip**:If using a mac use 'curl -LO' instead!

We will now change into that directory and download a second file. This file is actually zipped, so we will also decompress this.

```bash
$ cd boosted_barebonesbash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-images
$ unzip Boosted-BBB-images

## and remove the original zip archive
$ rm Boosted-BBB-images
```

## Where is my stuff??

One of first things you want to do when working on the command line is to find out where the directories/files that you want to work with are. In these modern times, this can be hundreds or even thousands of files.

<p align="center">
  <img title="https://giphy.com/gifs/download-find-funsubstancea-XSJIE5xMWA9HO
" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XSJIE5xMWA9HO/giphy.gif">
</p>

So, how can you search for files and directories hidden in layers and layers of (your of course very organised ;)) directories?

For this task, you can use the command `find`

Let's see how this command works with an example:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*JPG'
```

The **first** part of the `find` command indicates **the place from which to start looking**, in the example above, this is the directory `Boosted-BBB`. You can also specify:

- `.` to look in here (the current directory)
- `~/` to look in your home directory
- Absolute path (i.e.`/home/james`). Note: This will print the absolute path and the found file/directory, it is useful when you want to use the output of `find` for other things

> Keep in mind that it will look in the directory specified and all of it's subdirectories unless indicated otherwise!

The **second** part of the `find` command indicates **what type of things you are looking for**

- Use `-type` to define the file type

    - **f**ile
    - **d**irectory

In the example above we are looking for files (`-type f`)

The **third** part of the `find` command is **what to look in**

- Use `-name` to say 'look in the *names* of things'

**Finally**, we provide the actual string to look for.

In the example above, we look for files that contain `JPG` in some part of their name (`'*JPG*'`).
- You can use wildcards (\*) for maximum laziness! 

Check what the output of the find command is by, running it:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*JPG'
```

You can also store the string we are looking for in a variable instead! By doing this, you can change the string for another easily in the future (this will be useful when creating scripts, which we will cover later in the session), without having to modify the command itself. 

To do so, let's store our string `JPG` in a variable:

```bash
$ suffix="JPG"
```

Let's try now to call the variable in our find command as:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB -type f -name '*$suffix'
```

**BUT WAIT**! There was no output? It did not find any of the files!!?

But we know the files do exist (_trust us_)! Let's try the following command istead:

```
find Boosted-BBB -type f -name "*$suffix"
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://tenor.com/view/nagato-naruto-shippuden-nagato-kid-nani-apa-gif-12417317.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/nagato-naruto-shippuden-nagato-kid-nani-apa-gif-12417317.gif" width="70%">
</p>

üéâ It found your files! What is the difference between these commands?

That's right! The _quotes_!

## Concept: Quotes matter!

Which quotes you use plays an important role in how bash understands the message contained within them:

* Single quotes: the content is passed on as it is written
* Double quotes: the content is _interpreted_

In some cases, the way you write the statments does not matter, as in the following example:

```bash
$ echo "I like Greek Food"
$ echo 'I like Greek Food'
```
This two statements will result in the same (universally true) printed message:

```
I like Greek Food
I like Greek Food
```

Now let's consider the following example:

```bash
$ Arr=Banana
$ echo 'Pirates say $Arr'
$ echo "Minions say $Arr"
```

Here, the results are different:

```
Pirates say $Arr
Minions say Banana
```

<p align="center">
    <div class="row">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/NSqQkXJjnsVpZQezfg/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/NSqQkXJjnsVpZQezfg/" width="90%">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/bh4jzePjmd9iE/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/bh4jzePjmd9iE/" width="90%">
    </div>
</p>

As you can see in the case of single quotes, bash does not interpret the variable `$Arr` as Banana, since it is not being translated by the computer to the correct meaning. In the case of the double quotes, the program understands `$Arr` as a variable, and interprets it to mean the string contained within it which is`"Banana"`. 

Now, let's continue with your files!

## Cleaning up the filenames

So... you found your files, but it seems that whoever ave you files has (üëÄ) completely mangled the file names (_[What is with this weird file extention `.JPG.MP3.TXT`???]_]

You know that already that these files are supposed to be images with the extension `.JPG` (_[clearly]_). So let's clean up the file names, and then we can sort them into categories. 

There are different ways to tackle this problem. First, we will show you an example that uses `cut` and `rev`.

Can you guess what these commands do?

* `rev`: reverses a character string
* `cut`: cuts a string into multiple pieces

<div class="row">
<p align="center">
  <img style="transform: scaleX(-1)" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mUGRVgAkamLZe/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/pony-mUGRVgAkamLZe" width="90%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img style="transform: scaleX(-1)" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2GdACZsbRnTmo/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-photoset-2GdACZsbRnTmo" width="83%">
</p>
</div>

Let's try them out!

```bash
$ echo "aBcDeF 654321" | rev
```

This results in:

```text
123456 FeDcBa
```

Now let's see how `cut` work. This command needs some options to know how to deal with the string. Those are:

* `-d` specifies the field **d**elimiter we are using. Here it is space (" ").
* `-f` specifies which **f**ield we wish to cut out. We want to recover the numbers, so this will be the second field.
* 
> For more options, check the `man` page!

Let's write the command to obtain the number then:

```bash
$echo "aBcDeF 654321" | cut -d " " -f 2
```

And the result is:

```
654321
```

So let's combine these two tools to clean up our file names. 

You will use a `for` loop to change all the file names you have found with the `find` command to the desired ending (filename containing only the `.JPG` extension)

The `for` loop will look like this:

```bash
$ suffix=JPG
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>    new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>    echo $file $new_name
> done
```

> **Tip**: Remember that the `>` at the beginning of a code block 
> indicates a multi-line command. You can replace these with `;` 
> to write the whole loop on a single line
 
You should use `echo` to make a 'dry-run', meaning that you can try your code without making any changes to files themselves. 

When you are happy with the output from the echo command, you can replace `echo` with the `mv` command, and re-run the `for` loop to change the name of the file for the `$new_name`.

```bash
$ suffix=JPG
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>    new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>    mv $file $new_name
> done
```

But hold up...

**This code is cumbersome to write, read and understand.**

<p align="center"><img src="https://tenor.com/view/what-confused-ugh-blackadder-rowan-atkinson-gif-11050590.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/what-confused-ugh-blackadder-rowan-atkinson-gif-11050590.gif" width="40%">
</p>

### Wait, what just happened? 

Let's break the code in parts to understand what is going on:

* `for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do`: this starts the for loop. The `$()` tells bash to use the _output_ of the `find` command as the list to loop through. 
    * `new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)`: `$()` tells bash to run the commands within parenthesis and interpret the output as a string. The string is then assigned to the `new_name` variable
        * `echo $file`: print the filepath
    
        `~/boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB/Friday/night/and/the/lights/are/low/fanta.JPG.MP3.TXT`
    
        * `rev`: **rev**erses the file name:
        `TXT.3PM.GPJ.atnaf/wol/era/sthgil/eht/dna/thgin/yadirF/BBB-detsooB/hsabsenoberab_detsoob/~`
        * `cut -d "." -f 2-999`: **cut**s the string at each "." (the `-d`elimiter) and keeps everything after the first delimiter (`-f`ields `2-999`):
         `3PM.GPJ.atnaf/wol/era/sthgil/eht/dna/thgin/yadirF/BBB-detsooB/hsabsenoberab_detsoob/~`
        * `rev`: **rev**erses to the original file name: 
        `~/boosted_barebonesbash/Boosted-BBB/Friday/night/and/the/lights/are/low/fanta.JPG.MP3`
    * `mv`: Finally, we rename the file to `new_name` with `mv`
* `done`: complete the loop
    
### Writing pretty code

The code we just saw was long and unnecessary. It is a good idea to avoid clunky code, because often it can be slow but more importantly unreadable to yourself and others!


To simplify this code we can instead use bash's **parameter expansion**! (It's magic!)

<p align="center"><img src="https://tenor.com/view/fantastic-beasts-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-strudel-magic-food-gif-7865320.gif" title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/fantastic-beasts-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-strudel-magic-food-gif-7865320.gif" width="50%">
</p>

## Parameter expansion: Without the parameters

Parameter expansion is a feature in bash that allows you to manipulate _variables_. Let's explore some examples!

Given the variable:

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
```

You can expand the variable by using `${}`, like this:

```bash
$ echo ${foo}
```
"Expansion" of a variable is just "unpacking" of the variable to see its contents. So the code above will result into bash printing the variable's contents:

```bash
$ /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
```

This expansion is implied whenever you omit the curly brackets (`$foo` instead of `${foo}`). However, it is still a good idea to include these curly brackets, as it helps to visually distinguish variable names in your code, and to remove any ambiguity as to which is the name of the variable you are trying to expand. 

### Parameter expansion: _with_ parameters!

By adding parameters inside the variable expansion curly brackets, it is also possible to change the way that the variable contents are expanded <ins>without changing the variable definition itself!</ins>. 

Here are some examples:

* `#string`: removes the string from the left side of the variable
    ```bash
    $ echo ${foo}
    $ echo ${foo#/home/}
    ```
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    `
    thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    
* `%string`: removes the string starting from the right side of the variable
    ```bash
    $ echo ${foo}
    $ echo ${foo%.txt}
    ```
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
    `
    `
    /home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
    `
    
You can use wildcards within this parameterised expansions as below:

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"

$ echo ${foo}    # No parameters in this expansion
$ echo ${foo#*/} # Removes everything before the first '/'
$ echo ${foo%.*} # Removes everything after the last '.'
```
Results in:

```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
```

Additionally, to remove __all__ matches of the specified pattern, you can repeat the parameter specifier a second time (`##` or `%%`):

```bash
$ echo ${foo##*/} # Removes everything before any '/'
$ echo ${foo%%.*} # Removes everything after any '.'
```

`
BBB.is.bae.txt
`

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB
`

### More parameters for expansion

Other than removing parts of the variable contents, parameters will allow you to substitute only parts of them as well!

* `/pattern/string`: substitutes the first occurrence of the pattern in the variable contents by the given string

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}                    # No parameters
$ echo ${foo/BBB/BareBonesBash}  # Change "BBB" to "BareBonesBash"
```

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
`

`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BareBonesBash.is.bae.txt
`

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/adweek-color-apple-8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/links" width="75%">
</p>

Omitting the string will remove the given pattern (i.e. replace it with an empty string).

*  `/pattern/`: substitutes the string with an empty string

```bash
$ echo ${foo/BBB}  # Remove BBB
```
`
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/.is.bae.txt
`

As before, repeating the parameter specifier (`/`) will apply the substitution to __all__ matches of the pattern!

```bash
$ echo ${foo}
$ echo ${foo//is/IS} ## Replace any occurance of 'is' to 'IS'
$ echo ${foo//is} ## Remove all occurances of 'is'
```
`/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt`
`/home/thISeas/folder/subfolder/BBB.IS.bae.txt`
`/home/theas/folder/subfolder/BBB..bae.txt`

### The last parameter, I swear!

Finally, you can check the length of the variable contents (how many characters long they are) by using a `#` BEFORE the variable name.

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${#foo}  # The length of the variable contents
```
`45`

So the filepath in `foo` is 45 characters long!

" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9DLukkavmhybAs/giphy.gif
" width="40%">
</p>

This parameter will become more handy when when dealing with bash _arrays_ (i.e. lists of things), but these will not be introduced here.

## Writing pretty code
We can now rewrite the code below:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*$suffix*"); do
>   new_name=$(echo $file | rev | cut -d "." -f 2-999 | rev)
>   echo $file $new_name
> done
```

To this:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*JPG*"); do
>   echo ${file} ${file%.*}
> done
```

Try running both codes using only the printing command `echo` before modifying the actual variable (dry-running) and check that the result is the same! 

Is there a difference in runtime?

Using a command timer on both for loops above, I got the result: `0.051s` versus `0.003s` respectively! Parameter expansion is quicker because it does not rely on piping together 4 different commands.

<p align="center">

</p>

When you are sure the filename `${file%.*}` is as intended, replace `echo` with `mv` in the 2nd codeblock to rename the files! The final code should look like this:

```bash
$ for file in $(find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*JPG*"); do
>   mv ${file} ${file%.*}
> done
```

## Almost done!

We now have all the files named similarly, but some things are still a bit off. The file suffix `.JPG` is conventionally written in lowercase characters (i.e. `.jpg`).

So, let's change all filename suffixes to be in lowercase letters!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3diMwu8XYh6sa6VG/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/laffmobbslafftracks-laff-mobbs-tracks-episode-108-l3diMwu8XYh6sa6VG" width="30%">
</p>

While this operation could also be done with a parameter expansion substituting each filename one by one, we can be EVEN LAZIER and use something called **reg**ular **ex**pressions (a.k.a regex). This allows us to do this without a for loop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/kaNy16D5G7fyybuIZ4/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/cbs-ncisla-1110-ncisla1110-kaNy16D5G7fyybuIZ4" width="30%">
</p>

Regex is an important concept that you encounter in most programming languages.

The actual way you write regex may vary from language to language, but the concept is essentially the same. In the following section, we will show here's how they work in bash!

## Concept: Regular expressions

Regex are special strings and characters that define a 'search pattern'. 

They are normally used in 'Search' or 'Search/Replace' functions e.g. in Excel! And: **You have already used them!** (sort of)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KWbmr5E1UdPUI/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/way-matt01ss-KWbmr5E1UdPUI/links" width="30%">
</p>


There are three regex special character 'categories' you should keep in mind:

* `.`, `*`, `^`, `$` (etc.): 
    * special characters <br>These are translated to regex **by default**. They can be "escaped" with `\` when you wish to use the literal symbol instead.
* `\t`, `\w`, `\D` (etc.): 
    * letter-based special characters <br> These characters require `\` to be 'translated' (i.e. the opposite of special characters).
* `[]`, `()`, (etc.): 
    * range, grouping, or 'capturing' matching regex <br> These can be specified within different types of brackets

We will showcase them by applying some search function in a file. For this, you will need to download the file `regex.txt` using the code below.

```bash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-regex
$ mv Boosted-BBB-regex regex.txt
```
Let's also look at the contents of this file.

```bash
$ cat regex.txt
```

Try to remember the contents of the file for the next few steps (or if you forget, re-run the command to remind yourself!)

Now let's see which 'parameters' we can use to try to find different words using grep!

#### 1. `.` : **matches any character.** 

The code below:

```bash
$ grep '.ear' regex.txt
```

> Finds strings containing: any character + ear

Prints:

```
pear
bear
rear
```

</p>

#### 2. `[]`: **match range of characters within the square brackets.**

Try:

```bash
$ grep 'p[iea]r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with p+[one of: i, e, a]+r

And you should see:

```
pir
per
par
```

#### 3. `[^]`: **match range of characters excluding the ones in the square brackets.**

Run:

```bash
$ grep 'p[^iea]r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with p+[any except: i, e, a]+r

And you should get:

```
pur
```

#### 4. `*`: **match 0 or more of the preceding items**

```bash
$ grep 'be*r' regex.txt
```

> String that starts with b+ zero or more 'e' +r

You should get:

```
beer
br
ber
```

<p align="center">

</p>

#### 5. `\`: **do not interpret next character**

```bash
$ grep 'be\*r' regex.txt
```

> String 'be*r'

Gives:

```
be*r
```
By escaping the asterisk, the regex looks for an *actual* asterisk character instead of matching 0 or more of the preceding items.

#### 6. `\+`: **match 1 or more of the preceding items**

```bash
$ grep 'be\+r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with b+ one or multiple 'e'+r

Matches:

```
beer
ber
```
Notice the difference in the resulting matches between `\+` and `*`! `br` is NOT matched with `\+` because we arre looking for *at least one* `e`.

<p align="center">

</p>

#### 7. `\?`: match 0 or 1 of the preceding items

```bash
$ grep 'be\?r' regex.txt
```

> String starting with b+ zero or one 'e' +r

You should get:

```
br
ber
```
Compare the matching results to those of `\+`. `beer` is no longer matched because it has two `e` characters and `\?` matches only up to one.

#### 8. `^`: the beginning of the line

```bash
$ grep '^[rb]\+' regex.txt
```

> Lines starting with [0 or 1 of: r or b]

You should get:

```
bear
beer
br
ber
be*r
rear
```

</p>

#### 9. `$`: the end of the line

```bash
$ grep 'r$' regex.txt
```

> Line ending with r

```
pear
pier
pir
per
par
pur
bear
beer
br
ber
be*r
rear
```

## Regex example!

Now, going back to our list of files

```
fanta.JPG
BydgoszczForest.JPG
snore.JPG
Bubobubo.JPG
giacomo.JPG
netsukeJapan.JPG
nomnom.JPG
pompeii.JPG
AlopochenaegyptiacaArnhem.JPG
exhibitRoyal.JPG
stretch.JPG
weimanarer.JPG
excited.JPG
licorne.JPG
angry.JPG
```

What sort of regex would you use to find all files ending with `.JPG`?

If we want to match a specific set of characters, that always follow a `.` and then end with a specific string?

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*.JPG'
```

Oooh look, we've done this before. üòâ

## `rename`

So while we can find the files with regex, how do we actually rename them in the super-lazy and fast method we mentioned above?

We can use a tool called `rename`!

`rename` lets you apply a regex to the name of files to rename them!

> Note: this is not always installed by default in some Unix operating systems, but is almost always easily installable via the corresponding package manager.

To convert all suffixes in the directory to lowercase characters:

```bash
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name '*.JPG' | rename 's/\.JPG$/.jpg/'
```

You may note that substitution is written similar to what we used in parameter expansion (except with an extra `/`)!

> You can use `find` to check whether the names are now as you expect!

The `rename` 'one-liner' demonstrates that you don't need a for-loop to rename lots of files! Just pipe!

</p>


Here is what is happening when we use the command above, in a bit more detail:

1. We define we want to **s**ubstitute the regex matches for another string

2. We define the regex to query. `\.JPG$`

> Remember, we want to have the actual `.` character in the search string - therefore we _escape_ so it will not be 'translated' by regex.

3. Finally, we specify what we want to substitute anything that matches the search string with, which in this case is `.jpg`

## Onwards!

Ok, so we can now again use `find` to see all the new and pretty and cleaned up filepaths:

```bash
$ suffix="jpg"
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*${suffix}"
```

" width="40%">
</p>

Lets start sorting the pictures into categories, which we can later file under relevant folder names!

To do that, we need to keep track of all the file names. We can easily gather this information using a **redirect**!

## Concept: Datastreams!

Programs can take in and spit out data from different _streams_. By default there are 3 such data streams.

- `stdin`: the __st__ an __d__ ard __in__ put
- `stdout`: the __st__ an __d__ ard  __out__ put
- `stderr`: the __st__ an __d__ ard   __err__ or

> **PRO TIP:** Each programme also has an 'exit code', which can tell you if execution completed with/without errors. You will rarely see these in the wild.

<p align="center">
  <img src=".images/Datastreams.png" width="50%">
</p>]

<!-- image is stored in github repo so relative link won't work on hack.md -->

_A program is like the human body; One way in, two ways out!_

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/4kg8IIClzvLtC/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/4kg8IIClzvLtC/" width="40%">

# Pipes revisited

In the first session you learned about piping. Here's how that works!

<img src=".images/Piping.png" width="100%">

<!-- image is stored in github repo so relative link won't work on hack.md -->

With a pipe, the `stdout` of one command becomes the `stdin` of the next!

`stderr` is printed on your screen.

## Concept: Redirects

Much like streams of water in the real world, datastreams can be redirected.

This way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file to save for later!


- `stdin` can be redirected with `<`.
    - An arrow pointing TO your program name!

- `stdout` can be redirected with `>`.
    - An arrow pointing AWAY your program name!

- `stderr` can be redirected with `2>`.
    - Because it is the secondary output stream.

It is also possible to combine streams, but we won't get into that here.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72EWUgbRNfLegO1W/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72EWUgbRNfLegO1W/" width="80%">
</p>

## Let's redirect!

We can get a list of all the file names by redirecting the `stdout` of the `find` command.

```bash
$ suffix="jpg"
$ find Boosted-BBB/ -type f -name "*${suffix}" > File_names.txt
```

This time, nothing was printed on your screen. But don't panic, because you _redirected_ that output into the file specified after the `>`.

You can `cat` the resulting file to see that everything worked!

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JqDeI2yjpSRgdh35oe/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/JqDeI2yjpSRgdh35oe/" width="35%">
</p>

## Getting parts of a file path

Before moving on, there are two useful commands you should know.

`basename` will tell you the file name, while _stripping the path_ to the file.
```bash
$ basename data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life/bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```
```
bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```


`dirname`, on the otherhand, does the opposite. It will tell you the path to the directory that a file is in, while _omitting the name_ of the file.
```bash
$ dirname data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life/bubobubo.JPG.MP3.TXT
```
```
data/Boosted-BBB//Having/the/time/of/your/life
```

## Reading from a file

Ok, so you now have a file with all the paths to the images we need. But the folder structure that files are in is still a mess. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7vARoDgcIknS5wBQq6/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/abba-waterloo-7vARoDgcIknS5wBQq6" width="35%">
</p>

It's time to read the contents of the file with a `while` loop!

A `while` loop is a special type of repeating code that keeps going until it is interrupted.

We will also use `read`. This command takes the contents of the file and loads them into a specified variable.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WoWm8YzFQJg5i/source.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/cartoons-comics-sea-reading-WoWm8YzFQJg5i" width="35%">
</p>

```bash
$ mkdir images
$ while read filepath; do
>   echo "${filepath}" images/$(basename ${filepath})
>   # mv ${filepath} images/$(basename ${filepath})
> done < File_names.txt
```

Here we make a new directory to move all our files into. Then `while` we are still `read`ing lines from the contents of a file, we will sign a given line to the variable `filepath`. Then we will `do` an `echo` of the original file path, and then a our new `path` in our new directory. Once we've finished the `while` loop we will close it down with `done`. And of course, we need to specify the file we want to `read` through. We do this with our `<` redirect we introduced earlier!

When you're ready, uncomment the `mv` command to move each file from the
original location into the new location!

> Question: in this context, why do you have to use 'basename' for the target directory?

## Concept: While Loops

Whoa hold up... maybe we went to fast.

We have previously introduced the concept of a loop, and already used a few today.

_from Basic BBB:_

```bash
$ for file in file1 file2 file3 file4; do
>   echo "${file}"
> done
```

`for` loops repeat a set of code for a set of items, by changing the value of a variable in each iteration. They always require some form of list, and therefore `for` loops are __finite__, they go through your list and stop when they run out of things.


Instead, a `while` loop keeps going until a **statement** is false (i.e. can be infinite!).

```bash
$ while [statement]; do     #means while statement is true do
>   [whatever you want to do]
> done
```


An easy **pseudocode** example:

> Pseudocode is code-_like_ syntax, but a computer will NOT understand it. the code below won't work if you try to copy it over.

```bash
$ n=3
$ while n > 0; do
>   echo $n
>   n=$n - 1
> done
```

will result in 

```
3
2
1
```

The condition means that while the variable `$n` contains a number that is more than 0 (i.e.condition results in `TRUE`), go onto the next iteration of the loop. If `$n` is _not_ more than 0 (i.e.condition results in `FALSE`) when we complete the loop and run `done`.

Didn't you say while loop are infinite? 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/U2BASTIsaw8WQ/source.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/elevator-berlin-lift-U2BASTIsaw8WQ" width="90%">
</p>
]

What will this **Pseudocode** do?:

```bash
$ n=3
$ while n < 5; do
>   echo $n
>   n=$n - 1
> done
```

The number in `$n` will _always_ be less than 5 :scream:! That means the loop will never stop, unless interrupted!

Therefore **always** include a stop, i.e. ensure your condition will eventually become 'false'!

> In emergencies: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> (cancel the loop)

Now going back to our example from before...

```bash
$ while read filepath; do
>   echo "${filepath}" images/$(basename ${filepath})
> done < File_names.txt
```

`read` is a special function that makes the condition `read filepath` to become `FALSE` when there are no more lines in the file `File_names.txt` (i.e. '`EOF`').

> Programmer lingo: `EOF` means end of file! 

If you already executed the `while` loop renaming the files with `mv` command uncommented, you can now run `ls -l images/`  and you should now see all your cleanly-named image files in there, and not buried under all those _[genius]_ abba lyrics!

<!-- Thiseas got up to here -->

## Pasting things side by side!

As you remember from the beginning, we downloaded a metadata file, which
includes different metadata categories for each file. Maybe we can use this to make our collection of images _even more_ organised?

Lets look in the file!

```bash
$ cat Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

We can see have different metadata categories assigned to each image. 

Now we can put together a list that states which category each image is part of! However, we don't have the file paths to each image :-1:, which are stored in our `File_names.txt` file.

We can use a tool called `paste` to paste the two lists together, and save the results!

```bash
$ ls -1 images/* | paste - Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv # > Annotations.txt
```

> **Tip**: `ls -1` forces the output into a single column. `paste` accepts the `stdin` and puts it at the position of `-`


You should see with our _dry-run_ the file names in the first column, and all the metadata in the subsequent columns! 

```
images/alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem.jpg	alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem	C	Funny
images/angry.jpg	angry	B	Artwork
images/bubobubo.jpg	bubobubo	C	Normal
...
images/snore.jpg	snore	B	Normal
images/stretch.jpg	stretch	B	Funny
images/weimanarer.jpg	weimanarer	A	Normal
```

Once you're happy, remove the comment and make the `Annotations.txt` file!

You now have a meta-data sheet for each jpg!

> **Important Disclaimer**: literally pastes columns, no _matching_ done. Therefore this method _only_ works if both columns are in the corresponding/expected order!

## Editing text with `sed`

But to share these images with your internet friends, you need to properly specify the category names, the 'A', 'B', 'C', categories aren't very informative.

Let's add some _actual_ category names to the `Annotations.txt`.

For this we can use `sed`, short for **s**tream **ed**itor, with a regex to edit the contents of a datastream on-the-fly.

Remember how we have previously use `nano` to edit text files? Now we are going to be even more lazy and edit files _programmatically_!

Running:

```bash
$ sed 's/A/dog/' Annotations.txt
```

will result in

```
images/alopochenaegyptiacadogrnhem.jpg	alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem	C	Funny
images/angry.jpg	angry	B	dogrtwork
images/bubobubo.jpg	bubobubo	C	Normal
...
images/snore.jpg	snore	B	Normal
images/stretch.jpg	stretch	B	Funny
images/weimanarer.jpg	weimanarer	dog	Normal
```

Can you see what happened there? Do you see what went wrong?

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdYJK1wAdPWVk88/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdYJK1wAdPWVk88/" width="40%">
</p>

 Don't worry though, your file has not been changed in any way! A nice thing about `sed` is it's _default_ mode is to always do a dry run.
 
So what happened here and how can we fix it?
 
 Our replacement (similar to bash expansions earlier) replaced _any_ `A` character with dog (i.e. we now have `dogrtwork`).
 
The pattern matched  the first A in a line with `dog`. We therefore should make our regex more specific!

We know the value we want is a column, and hence it is surrounded by TABs! We can therefore change the pattern to 's/\tA\t/\tdog\t/' to only match a single character column.

```bash
$ sed 's/\tA\t/\tdog\t/' Annotations.txt
```

results in

```
images/alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem.jpg	alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem	C	Funny
images/angry.jpg	angry	B	Artwork
images/bubobubo.jpg	bubobubo	C	Normal
...
images/snore.jpg	snore	B	Normal
images/stretch.jpg	stretch	B	Funny
images/weimanarer.jpg	weimanarer	dog	Normal
```
> On Macs, `sed` does not recognise `\t`.You will need to type in a tab character.

Much better!

To add _multiple_ changes we can use `-e` to provide multiple regular **e**xpressions to `sed`.

```bash
$ sed -e 's/\tA\t/\tdog\t/' -e 's/\tB\t/\tcat\t/' -e 's/\tC\t/\tbird\t/' Annotations.txt
```

Check the results for any errors.

When you are happy with the results, it is time to save the edits!

`sed` can edit a file **i**n place, with the `-i` option.
```bash
$ sed -i -e 's/\tA\t/\tdog\t/' -e 's/\tB\t/\tcat\t/' -e 's/\tC\t/\tbird\t/' Annotations.txt
```

> **Note**: On Mac, the `-i` option needs an argument so replace it with `-i ''`

## Cleanin' up my closet

Lets actually organise our into descriptive folders based our metadata file!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZylxniYTM4rOfltszT/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/queen-the-show-must-go-on-ZylxniYTM4rOfltszT" width="60%">
</p>


For this, we need to use _conditionals_. We briefly introduced this earlier with `while` loops. This is a comparison of two things,
and if they are the same something happens (typically indicated with `TRUE`), if different (typically indicated with `FALSE`), something else happens.

The most basic conditional is an `if` `else` statement.


The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
$ if [[ ${my_variable} == "banana" ]]; then
>   echo "Monkey takes a banana and runs away happy."
> else
>   echo "Monkey doesn't want that."
> fi
```

You can have _sequential_ conditions too with `elif`, short for **el**se **if**.

```bash
$ if [[ ${my_variable} == "banana" ]]; then
>   echo "Monkey takes a banana and runs away happy."
> elif [[ ${my_variable} == "mango" ]]; then
>   echo "Monkey takes a mango and eats it while staring at you."
> else
>   echo "Monkey doesn't want that."
> fi
```

> Important: `[[` behaves different to `[`. Usually, `[[` is what you want. [_Long story, trust us._]

Can you guess what would happen here depending on the contents of `my_variable`?

Try re-running the statements after updating the variable in each of these:

```bash
$ my_variable="banana"
# Run if/else statement again here
$ my_variable="mango"
# Run if/else statement again here
$ my_variable="pear"
# Run if/else statement again here
```

## Conditions of conditionals

You can evaluate mathematical equations with `((`.

```bash
$ if (( 5 - 2 == 3)); then
>   echo "YES"
> fi
```
```
YES
```

`!` can be used in all conditions as a "not". (i.e. Turning a TRUE into FALSE and vice versa.
)

For example in a maths example:

```bash
$ if (( 5 - 2 == 3)); then
>   echo "YES"
> fi
```
```
YES
```

```bash
$ if ! (( 5 - 2 == 3)); then
>   echo "YES"
> else
>   echo "NO"
> fi
```
```
NO
```

> **Note**: `!` can act as a "not" with square brackets as well!


There are other special `bash` options that do conditions for you, e.g. to check if files exist, or is a variable has non-zero length.


```bash
$ if [[ -f Annotations.txt ]]; then
>   echo "File exists."
> fi

$ if [[ -n ${banana} ]]; then
>   echo "Variable is set."
> else
>   echo "Variable is NOT set."
> fi
```
```
File exists.
Variable is NOT set.
```

You can even combine multiple conditionals
 - `&&`: 'AND' - both must evaluate true 
  - `||`: 'OR' - at least one must evaluate true
  
For AND:

```bash
$ LifeUniverseEverything=42
$ hitchhikers="awesome"
## AND
$ if [[ ${LifeUniverseEverything} == 42  && ${hitchhikers} == "awesome" ]]; then
>   echo "Don't panic!"
> fi
```

and for OR:

```bash
$ LifeUniverseEverything=41
$ hitchhikers="awesome"
## OR
$ if [[ ${LifeUniverseEverything} == 42  || ${hitchhikers} == "awesome" ]]; then
>   echo "Still don't panic!"
> fi
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BVlWY2vMZgLG8/source.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/life-answer-42-BVlWY2vMZgLG8/" width="40%">
</p>

Play around with the `hitchikers` variable to get a feel of how it works!

## Sorting the images by category

We now want to create a directory for each category, and move images into the corresponding directory as recorded in our annotations file.

We will hfirst check that we can extract the correct information for the moving, i.e. the name of the file and the corresponding category we defined above. 

In our dry run we will print these two bits of information as extracted from the `Annotations.txt`.

```bash
$ cd ~/boosted_barebonesbash/

## Parse the annotations file into variables
$ while read line; do
>   image_name=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f1)
>   animal=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f3)
> 
>   echo "${image_name}    ${animal}"
> 
> done < Annotations.txt
```

And you should see:

```
images/alopochenaegyptiacaArnhem.jpg    bird
images/angry.jpg    cat
images/bubobubo.jpg    bird
images/bydgoszczForest.jpg    bird
[...]
images/pompeii.jpg    dog
images/snore.jpg    cat
images/stretch.jpg    cat
images/weimanarer.jpg    dog
```

Looks good! So now, we can use conditionals to decide which file should go into which category. Again, with dry runs with `echo`

```bash
$ cd ~/boosted_barebonesbash/

## Parse the annotations file into variables
$ while read line; do
>   image_name=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f1)
>   animal=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f3)
> 
>   # echo "${image_name}    ${animal}"
> 
>   ## Make a new directory for each animal, if one doesn't exist.
>   mkdir -p images/${animal}
> 
>   ## If animal matches one of the three, move the image.
>   if [[ ${animal} == "cat" ]]; then
>     echo "mv ${image_name} images/cat/"
>   elif [[ ${animal} == "dog" ]]; then
>     echo "mv ${image_name} images/dog/"
>   elif [[ ${animal} == "bird" ]]; then
>     echo "mv ${image_name} images/bird/"
>   fi
> 
> done < Annotations.txt
```

The if statement will check that the given `$animal` variable matches a corresponding string, and if so, it will move that file to the folder.

If you're happy with the dry-run commands from echo, then we do the real-deal `mv` commands!

```bash
$ while read line; do
>   image_name=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f1)
>   animal=$(echo "${line}" | cut -f3)
> 
>   # echo "${image_name}    ${animal}"
> 
>   ## Make a new directory for each animal, if one doesn't exist.

## Housekeeping

Let's see if everything moved where we wanted using find.

```bash
$ find ~/boosted_barebonesbash/images/ -type f -name "*jpg"
```
```
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/cat/snore.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/cat/giacomo.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/cat/excited.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/cat/angry.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/cat/stretch.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/dog/licorne.jpg

/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/bird/bydgoszczForest.jpg
/home/lamnidis/boosted_barebonesbash/images/bird/exhibitRoyal.jpg
```

Boom! Everything moved into the correct subfolder!

## But I have to do this every day!

We are already being lazy by getting the computer to loop through each file.

But what happens if you have to do the same thing **EVERYDAY**? 

Do you really wanna write all the commands every time?!

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iE4lKpKqwe7QIQCPjG/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/memecandy-iE4lKpKqwe7QIQCPjG" width="30%">
</p>

The ultimate goal of anyone working on the command line is to make a _program_ which you can run with a single command and it does all the work for you.

That program is called a **_script_**.

## What's a script?

Similar to a play/movie script that tells actors what to do and the sequence in which they should do it, a computer script is a file containing all the commands that you want the computer to perform in a given order.

So let's start writing your first script `first_script.sh`! Open a text editor.

```bash
$ nano first_script.sh
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26tn33aiTi1jkl6H6/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/26tn33aiTi1jkl6H6/" width="60%">
</p>

## Your first script!

The first thing you almost always need to do with any script is to specify which language the script is using. This is done with a 'shebang'

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mbi2vzeke98ApAA/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/season-14-the-simpsons-14x5-3o6Mbi2vzeke98ApAA
" width="30%">
</p>

It consists of a `#!` to indicate it's a shebang, then a path to a list that *unix stores locations of all programs in. There are different ways of specifying this, but we will use here the most 'accepted' way.

On the first line of your text editor window, type:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
```

In most cases, your shebang will be that exact path plus the language you are using.

e.g. for python it would be `#! /usr/bin/env python`.

For your first script, lets do something simple. The classic. We want the program to print "Hello world!".

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fedryX7dMGMe6lgqDm/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/computer-gif-artist-code-fedryX7dMGMe6lgqDm" width="30%">
</p>


How do we bash to print something in screen? Correct! You're an expert now: with `echo`!

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

echo "Hello world"
```

And save the file (if you don't remember how to do this, check [Basic BareBonesBash](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/bbb1/basic_barebonesbash_walkthrough?id=text-editing-in-terminal)).

That's it! You've made your first script!

## How do you run a script?

Now to run the script, we do:

```bash
$ bash ./first_script.sh
```

```
Hello world
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/PnUatAYWMEMvmiwsyx/source.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/SpongeBobMovie-spongebob-squarepant-PnUatAYWMEMvmiwsyx" width="30%">
  </p>
  
## Input Variables

Now we want to change our script to instead of saying `Hello world` (which is a bit boring), to make it talk to you, i.e. `Hello <your_name>`.

But how can the computer know your name? Well get the person to tell you of course!

Instead of our script looking like this:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

echo "Hello world"
```

We can use variables for the arguments passed to a script.

...wait... what are arguments?

Arguments are user supplied values when running the script in the prompt, that the script then will use to perform the tasks (with the argument taken into consideration).

In Bash, the arguments passed on the command line can be called `${1}`,`${2}`, where

- `${1}` is the first argument
- `${2}` is the second argument
- `${3}` is the third argument
- and so on,

supplied by the user in the terminal.

So let's go back to our script and change the printing message!

First, we want to take the first argument when running the command, and assign it to an informative variable.

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

name=${1}

echo "Hello world"
```

Then, as we want to print out "Hello < name >" instead of "Hello World",
we just need to replace `world` with the new `$name` variable!

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

name=${1}

echo "Hello ${name}"
```

> Remember, quotes matter!

Once you've updated your script, save, and lets try running the command again but this time by telling the script your name.

```bash
$ bash ./first_script.sh Aida
```
```
Hello Aida
```

<img src=".images/bbb_aida.svg" width="10%">

And that's pretty much it to start writing your script. Add normal commands you would normally run 'manually' on the terminal, but define your variables with user-supplied arguments!

## Best practices when coding

Ok, that's not _technically_ true. There are of course a few things that makes everyone's lives much better.

There are a few best practices that you should follow when writing code, to ensure that anyone can understand your code.

- Comment your code: add a short description of the steps. So in our first_script.sh, we should include:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

## Read name from positional arguments
name=${1}

## Printing Hello and the specified variable into screen
echo "Hello ${name}"
```

- Give variables informative names.
    - use `${name}` not just `${n}`
- Try to have all bash variables in `${}`. This helps distinguish them visually and ensures all variables are interpreted correctly.
- Keep the code simple: try to simplify your code instead of having 1,000 lines
    - This keeps it efficient, and is provides a good time to learn new things (with Google, of course :wink:)
- Avoid duplicating code.
    - You do this with things called `functions`, but we won't introduce this here.
 
There are also a few other suggestions that we would personally highly recommend.

1. Add a help message! This can be simply added with a conditional right at the beginning of the script. 
    - For example, in our basic script, we could add the following:

    ```bash
    #! /usr/bin/env bash

    name=${1}

    if [[ ${name} == "--help" || ${name} == "-h" ]]; then
      ## Print help message
      echo "This script prints Hello <your_name> into screen."
      echo "To run it type: bash ./first_script.sh <your_name>"
    else
      ## Printing Hello and the specified variable into screen
      echo "Hello ${name}"
     fi
    ```

    - You will often go back to old scripts and not remember the options and arguments they need.
    - Having help text will make it easier to remember.

</p>

2. Debugging your code!
    - Try your code outside the script!
    - Add print statements at each step of the script (with `echo`). These will be printing to console when each step is reached in the script (providing the script doesn't fail before the step).
    - Add print statements to check the variables/commands render properly

    
3. Write the script by its functional parts. 
    - Think what you want your script to do
    - Write/Draw the steps to do
    - Write code for the first step -> try it -> write code for the next step -> try it -> repeat until the end
    - Simplify your code! Practise going back and finding more simplisitic routes to accomplish tasks.

4. Explain your code to someone else! 
    - Talking through the logic of it will often make the problem obvious.
    - This is called the [rubber ducky debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) approach. Many programmers have a rubber duck on their desk, who to explain their code to.

</p>

## Things to keep in mind

Code for the same task can be written in multiple ways

  - Some code is more **efficient** -> a.k.a runs faster.
  - Some code is more **readable**.

Some code is _both!_, Some code is neither... it's normally a tradeoff...

</p>

**Remember:** Practice makes perfect: the more you do it, the more you learn.

## Time to practice!

Your task now will be to generate a script to perform the image sorting that we have shown you in this presentation.

**BUT:** This time you will need to make __an extra subdirectory within each of the categories__ with the secondary description of the images!
> That is column 3 of the metadata file. (Artwork, Baby, Funny, Historical, Normal)


For this, please make a new directory and download the data again:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/boosted_barebonesbash_scripting
$ cd ~/boosted_barebonesbash_scripting

## Get images zip and metadata file
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-images # On Mac: `curl -LO`
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-meta # On Mac: `curl -LO`

## Unzip image folders and rename metadata file
$ unzip Boosted-BBB-images
$ mv Boosted-BBB-meta  \
~/boosted_barebonesbash_scripting/Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

You are set up to start now!

## Today I learned...

To recap what we have gone through in this walkthrough:

- Basic BBB recap!
- `find` to locate files or directories
- Difference between `""` and `''`
- `rev`, `cut`, and bash expansion (`${}`) for manipulating strings
- Regular expressions for weird and wonderful pattern matching
- `rename` for renaming files
- Plumbing: standard in and out, pipes and re-directs
- `basename`/`dirname` getting just filenames or directories from paths 
- While loops (reading contents of files)
- `sed` for on-the-fly string manipulation _within_ files
- If statements and conditionals (if this, then do that, else do this)
- Scripts and arguments (now you're a programmer! Yes, you!)

## _OPTIONAL:_ Rerun: Enter the janitor!

Despite being lazy - you should ALWAYS keep your room tidy.

- This stops losing files
- Prevents getting lost in a maze of directories
- Accidentally permanently deleting a days worth of work .small[

\[_don't ask how many times this has happened._\]]

Once you feel comfortable you've completed all today's tasks to your satisfaction, lets remove:
  - the  `boosted_barebonesbash` directory 
  - **all of its contents**. 

```bash
$ cd ~     # Don't delete a directory 
         # while we are still in it! 
$ rm -r boosted_barebonesbash*
```
