## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to advance your knowledge gained from [Basic BareBonesBash](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/bbb1/README). Basic BBB introduced fundamental concepts on how to do basic navigation _[Thiseas still insists on that fancy word...]_, moving and read files, and generating basic information statistics on thse files. In this session, we will focus on more realistic 'useful' scenarios when it comes to the command line. We will be covering ways of speeding up and automating tasks using more 'abstract' but very common computing concepts. However, don't worry! We will be taking it slowly and gently, and of course, full of GIFs!

## tl;dr
